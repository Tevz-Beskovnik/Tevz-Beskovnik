## Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second-year university student at FERI. Studying Computer Science and Information Technologies.

I have a total of 5 years amateur experience as well as 3 years of professional working experience on frontend and backend applications with multiple tech stacks, as well as embedded systems, such as the Espressif platform and the Arduino development boards, with a little bit of PCB development sprinkled into the mix.

### My recent endeavours:

- Internship as a fullstack developer at Norik Systems
- Fullstack developer at I.T. TIM
- Backend engineer at [Kodex](https://kodex.io)
- Software developer at Solve-X
- Embeded engineer at DeweSoft
- Project planner and lead developer of MatchScore (a badminton tournament scoring system - TBA)

### My recent projects:

- **Bolt-engine** game engine built in C++ with GLFW and OpenGL, supporting object loading, scenes, render layers and programmable cameras, as well as objects.
- **ESPhandheld** a ESP32-based handheld device for gaming and a little bit of whitehat hacking.
- **MatchScore** badminton tournament scoring system, **TBA**.

And most likely some stuff that I am forgetting

### My future plans

- Voxel render/game engine written in Rust
- OS kernel written in Rust

Currently on a Rustcation ðŸ¦€ðŸŒ´
